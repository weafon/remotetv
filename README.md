你會邊吃飯 邊從電視看youtube嗎?

**有時 選錯片 要退片...**
這時 你是不是要放下拿筷子的手 
改拿起遙控器...
偏偏 遙控器又不知道丟到哪? 找了半天
改完片...再拿回筷子吃飯之類的

**有時 博主講太慢 或是netflix演太慢 你想跳片**
結果就要一直按幼 幼 幼 幼 幼 沒完
跳了半天 然後還要按回enter鍵

**有時你精彩的內容看到一半, 有事要離開沙發**
這時你想要暫停...
結果遙控器又不知道跑到哪邊去
找了半天....
等到回到座位...又找了半天遙控器 
才能開始繼續看

如果你有以上三種類似的情況
那麼 你需要一個 
**超音波手勢電視遙控器**

拿著筷子邊揮揮手 就可以操控電視的youtube
離開座位 就會自動暫停
回到座位 又可以繼續撥放

Do you watch YouTube on TV while eating?

**Sometimes I have to return the wrong film...**
At this time, should you put down your chopsticks?
Pick up the remote control instead...
I don't know where I lost the remote control. I searched for it for a long time.
After the film is changed...then take back the chopsticks to eat and so on

**Sometimes the blogger speaks too slowly or Netflix plays too slowly and you want to skip the movie**
The result is that you have to keep pressing the button "young, young, young, young" until the end.
After jumping for a long time, I have to press the enter key again

**Sometimes you need to get off the couch when you are halfway through watching an exciting content**
You want to pause...
I don't know where the remote control went.
After searching for a long time...
When I got back to my seat, I spent a long time looking for the remote control.
To start watching

If you have any of the above three similar situations
Then you need a
**Ultrasonic Gesture TV Remote Control**

You can control the YouTube on TV by waving your hands while holding chopsticks
When you leave your seat, it will automatically pause.
Return to your seat and continue playing
